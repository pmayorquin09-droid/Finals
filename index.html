      <h2>Systems Design, Engineering, and Organization</h2>
      <p>
        When considering the ideas of systems design, engineering, and organization. I first would focus on the simplicity of the systems’ design, the stability and performance when engineering, and the data integration when organizing said digital environment. I would say that these are important to focus on because they make sure that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not only can the system be used by more users, simplicity also can help to address problems with legibility, maintainability, and reliability (Connolly, 2025).</li>
        <li>Stability and performance being focused on can address growth and demand, become more adaptable and flexible, but can also help with cost-effectiveness and flexibility (Toro, 2025).</li>
        <li>Finally, focusing on data integration can make sure that when combining data from various sources, you are able to organize them into a unified view that helps with seamless data flow (LUMENALTA, n.d.).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Content and Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Next, when considering content and information architecture in the development of a digital environment. I would try to focus on User-Centered Design and Content Relationships. Focusing on these allows for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The users to have a better experience with the environment because you will be able to help understand the user’s needs and goals, prioritize the content being seen, and help consider the context in which users will be using said environment (Clay, 2025).
        </li>
        <li>
          Content relationships help to define how different content relates to each other and when used correctly, can help to establish a cohesive structure that makes the environment feel more well-rounded (Kaley, 2024).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User Experience and Visual Design</h2>
      <p>
        Also, in the context of user experience and visual design, when it comes to a digital environment, I believe it important to focus on the principles of Accessibility/Inclusivity and visual aesthetic.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Focusing on accessibility and inclusivity can help you design for all users, not just a select few. This means that more people can use your digital environment and benefit from it. This also heightens the user experience for everyone (NCDPI, 2024).
        </li>
        <li>
          Aesthetic is also important to focus on as it can help you to have uncluttered interfaces that can enhance usability and improve focus rather than overwhelming users (Livingston, n.d.).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bias in Development</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, when considering the area of bias in the development of a digital environment. I believe that it is important to focus on the data collection methods being used. I believe that this is important because it can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Help reduce the amount of bias that is being introduced by helping you take data from more sources and not clutter up data collection with biased sources. For example, relying solely on digital sources can introduce bias to your data collection (Lieu et al., 2020).
        </li>
      </ul>
